# These files are the main drivers of a First-In/First-Out worksheet that I created in Microsoft Excel in order to help our team analyze how well the operators in our warehouse were following our freight put-away processes.

# Due to confidentiality agreements with our customer, I have omitted the actual worksheet as it pertains many references to part numbers, etc. Unfortunately without these references intact, it cannot function.
